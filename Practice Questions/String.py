# 1 - Create 3 variables to store street, city and country, now create address variable to store entire address. Use two ways
#of creating this variable, one using + operator and the other using f-string. Now Print the address in such a way that
#the street, city and country prints in a separate line 


street = "Delta 1"
city = "Greater Noida"
country = "India"

address1 = street + city + country
address2 = f" {street} { city } { country} "

#print ( street + "\n" + city + "\n" +country)














 # 2. Create a variable to store the string "Earth revolves around the sun"
# i. Print "revolves" using slice operator
 # ii. Print "sun" using negative index


fact = "Earth revolves around the sun"

#print(fact[6:14])

#print(fact[-4:])















#Create two variables to store how many fruits and vegetables you eat in a day. Now Print "I eat x veggies and y fruits
#daily" where x and y presents vegetables and fruits that you eat everyday. Use python f string for this.


fruits = 1
veggies = 3

#print ( f" i eat {fruits} fruits and {veggies} vegetables daily " ) 

















#4. I have a string variable called s='maine 200 banana khaye'. This of course is a wrong statement, the correct statement
#is 'maine 10 samosa khaye'. Replace incorrect words in original strong with new ones and print the new string. Also try
#to do this in one line.

s='maine 200 banana khaye'

#print(s.replace("200 banana" , "10 samosa"))
