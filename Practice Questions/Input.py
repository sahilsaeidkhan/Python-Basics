# 1. Write a program that can find area of a triangle. It should take base and height as an input from user and using that it
#should print an area of a triangle


#base = input("Enter base ")
#height = input("Enter height ")

 # area = 1/2 * int (base) * int(height) ;

#print(area)




































#2. Write a program that takes file name with extension as an input and prints just the file name without extension (you

file_name = input("enter file with extension ")

final = file_name[:-4]

print(final)
